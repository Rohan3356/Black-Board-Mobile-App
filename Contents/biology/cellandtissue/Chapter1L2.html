				<p>A group of animal cells with similar size, shape, and specific functions are called animal tissues. On the basis of their size, shape and function, they are divided into four major types. They are:</p>

				
				<ul>
					<li>Epithelial tissue.</li>
					<li>Muscular tissue.</li>
					<li>Connective tissue.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2> Muscular Tissue.</h2>
                
                <p>Muscular tissue contains many small, longitudinal and parallel contractile fibers called myofibrils. They may be uni-nucleated or multinucleated. On the basis of their positions and functions, they are of following types:</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Skeketal muscle:</h3>
                <p>The movement of the muscle is under the control of skeletal muscle. So, they are also called voluntary muscle.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Smooth muscle:</h3>
                <p> Their movement is not under the control of ones will thus it is also called involuntary muscle. They have the unique power of rhythmic contraction.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Cardiac muscle:</h3>
                <p>It has characteristics of both skeletal and smooth muscle. It contracts automatically and rhythmically.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Connective Tissue</h2>
                <p>Connective tissue connects and provides support to the various organs of the body together. By the nature of the matrix, they are of three types. They are:</p>
				<br>
                <h3>Connective tissue proper: </h3>
                <p>It surrounds organs and tissues such as muscles, nerves, bones, kidney etc. It helps to strengthen the structure and helps to repair the tissue</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Skeletal connective tissue:</h3>
                <p>It provides support for the body and forms the rigid framework for the attachment of the muscles.</p>
                <br>
                <h3><h3>Skeletal connective tissue:</h3>

                <br>
                    <h3>Fluid connective tissue:</h3>
                <p>It circulates in the body and is responsible for the transportation of materials from one place to another.</p>
                <br>
                    <h2>Nervous Tissue</h2>
                    <p>hey perform the function of response and conduction of impulses. It consists of nerve cells and nerve fibers. The unit of the nervous system is called neuron.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A neuron consists of two parts: cell body and nerve fibers. The cell body is the round structure and has two types of nerves fibers generated from it. They are Dendron and Axon. The branch of dendron is called dendrites. Dendron carries impulses to the cell body whereas axon carries impulses from the cell body to dendrites.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Points to remember</h2>
