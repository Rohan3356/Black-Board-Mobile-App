				<h4 style="color: deepskyblue;">Asexual Reproduction</h4>
				<p>Reproduction is one of the important and essential characteristics of living organisms. Organisms reproduce in order to multiply their numbers and to maintain the continuity of their species. The process of production of new individuals by the organisms to continue their generation is the reproduction found in organisms</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are two different methods by which different organisms reproduce.</p>

				
				<ul>
					<li>Asexual reproduction</li>
                    <li>Sexual reproduction</li>
				</ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Asexual reproduction</h3>

				<p>The reproduction that takes place without the fusion of male and female gametes is called asexual reproduction. In this types of reproduction, similar types of new organisms develop from a single organism. Such reproduction takes place in simple unicellular organisms like amoeba, paramecium, etc. These organisms multiply their number by simple division method from a single parent by a process of fission. Organisms like Yeast, hydra also reproduce asexually.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Types of asexual reproduction:</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Fission</h3>
                
                <p>The type of reproduction in which one individual divide itself into two or more daughter individual by some mechanism is called fission. It is of two types:</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Binary fission: </h3>
                <p>The asexual reproduction in which one organism divides into two daughter organisms is called binary fission. This type of reproduction generally occurs in Amoeba, Euglena, and Paramecium etc.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Multiple fission: </h3>
                <p>The asexual reproduction in which one organism divides into many daughter organisms is called multiple fission. This type of reproduction generally occurs in Plasmodium (malaria parasite) and Chlamydomonas.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Budding</h3>
                <p>During budding, a small end produced on the body of the organism grows fully and is detached from the main body part after maturity and starts living on its own, is called budding.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Vegetative Propagation</h3>
                <p>The reproduction, which generally occurs only in plants from various vegetative organs like root, stem, leaves etc. through the process of cutting, grafting, layering etc., is called vegetative propagation. E.g. through root: sweet potato, mint etc., through leaves: poryophylum begania etc., through stem: sugarcane, ginger etc</p>
                <br>
