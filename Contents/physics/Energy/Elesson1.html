			</div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p>Source of energy is anything which supplies us useful energy for carrying out the various activities like:</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>Heat energy to cook food</li>
					<li>Electrical energy to lighten the room.</li>
					<li>Muscular energy to carry bag and to run bicycle.</li>
					<li>Sound energy to call friends.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4 style="color: skyblue;">Types of energy</h4>
				<ol type="a">
					<li><b>Renewable and Non-Renewable Source of Energy</b></li>
					<p>Renewable source of energy is the energy source which can be replenished in short period. Example Solar energy, hydropower
						An energy source which cannot be recreated in short period is categorized as non-renewable source of energy. Example Fossil Fuel-oil, natural gas, Coal.
					</p>
					<li><b>Good Sources of Energy</b></li>
					<p>A good source of energy has following characteristics:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>It could do a large amount of work per unit volume or mass.</li>
						<li>It would be easily accessible.</li>
						<li>It would be easy to store and transport.</li>
						<li>It would be economical.</li>
					</ol>

					<li><b>Conventional and Non -Conventional Source of Energy</b></li>
					<p>Sources of energy which has been in use from Centuries are called the conventional source of energy. Example: Wood, Coal, Petrol, hydropower.
						Source of energy which we have started using in recent times is called Non-conventional energy sources Example Nuclear energy, Geothermal energy, Solar energy, Ocean tides
					</p>
					<li><b>Fossils Fuels</b></li>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Fossils fuel are the remains of the pre-historic animal and plants buried under the earth millions of years ago.bv</li>
						<li>They are non-renewable sources of energy</li>
						<li>Since fossils fuels from plants and animals and they get energy from Sun, so their ultimate source of energy is Sun.</li>
