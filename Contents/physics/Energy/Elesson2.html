				<ul>
					<li><b>Tidal energy</b>
						<p>Gravitational pull of the moon on the spinning earth produces tides in the ocean.
							This phenomenon is called high and low tides and the difference in sea-levels gives us tidal energy. Tidal energy is harnessed by constructing a dam across a narrow opening to the sea. A turbine fixed at the opening of the dam converts tidal energy to electricity.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><b>Wave energy</b>
						<p>When the wind passes on the water surface, it leads to the pressure difference between upper and bottom wind which results in the generation of waves. This wave energy can be harnessed to power electric generator</p>
					</li>
					<li><b>Ocean Thermal energy</b>
						<p>The water at the surface of the sea or ocean is heated by the Sun while the water in deeper sections is relatively cold. Ocean-thermal-energy conversion plants Exploits this difference in temperature. The warm surface-water is used to boil a volatile liquid like ammonia. The vapors of the liquid are then used to run the turbine of generator. The cold water from the depth of the ocean is pumped up and condense vapor again to liquid.</p>
					</li>
					<li><b>Geothermal Energy</b>
						<p>Geo means earth and thermal means heat. So, geothermal energy is the energy which is obtained from heat inside the earth. Sometimes molten rocks formed in the deeper hot regions of earth’s crust are pushed upward and trapped in certain regions called ‘hot spots’ and when underground comes in it contact, steam is generated and that steam can be used to power turbine</p>
					</li>

					<li><b>Nuclear energy</b>
						<p>Nuclear energy is generated through the process of Nuclear Fission. In Nuclear fission, A heavy nucleus is bombarded with a low energy neutron. In this process, it splits into two lighter nuclei with a tremendous release of energy which can be utilized to boil water to run turbines. Nuclear energy is generated in a controlled manner in the Nuclear reactor. The major hazard of nuclear power generation is the storage and disposal of nucleus wastes because they are radioactive. Nuclear Fusion means joining lighter nuclei to make a heavier nucleus, most commonly hydrogen or hydrogen isotopes to create helium.
							2H + 2H → 3He (+ n)
							It releases a tremendous amount of energy,
							The source of energy in the Sun and other stars is also because of Nuclear fusion reaction.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><b>Hydrogen bomb</b>

						<p>The hydrogen bomb is based on thermonuclear fusion reaction. A nuclear bomb based on the fission of uranium or plutonium is placed at the core of the hydrogen bomb. This nuclear bomb is embedded in a substance which contains deuterium and lithium. When the nuclear bomb (based on fission) is detonated, the temperature of this substance is raised to 107 K in a few microseconds. The high temperature generates sufficient energy for the light nuclei to fuse and a devastating amount of energy is released.</p>
