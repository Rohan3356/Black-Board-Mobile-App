					<li>An image is formed when the light rays coming from an object meet at a point after reflection from a mirror (or refraction from lens).</li>
					<li>The images are of two types
						<ol>
							<li><b>Real Images</b> Real images are formed when rays of light that comes from an object (or source) meets at a point after reflection from a mirror (or refraction from a lens). Real images can be formed on a screen and can be seen with the eyes.</li>
							<li><b>Virtual images</b>: Virtual image is an image in which the outgoing rays from an object do not meet at a point. It will appear to meet at a point in or behind the optical device (i.e., a mirror) but they do not actually meet after reflection from a mirror (or refraction from a lens). A plane mirror always forms virtual images.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 style="color: skyblue;">Characteristics of images formed by mirrors:-</h4>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>Images formed by mirrors are always virtual and erect.</li>
					<li>Size of image is always equal to the size of the object and the image is laterally inverted.</li>
					<li>The images formed by the plane mirror are as far behind the mirror as the object in front of the mirror.</li>
				</ol>


				<h4 style="color: skyblue">Lateral inversion: </h4>
				<p>If an object is placed in front of the mirror, then the right side of the object appears to be the left side and left side of the object appears to be the right side of this image. This change of sides of an object and its mirror image is called lateral inversion.</p>
