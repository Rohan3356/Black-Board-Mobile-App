					<li>Light is a form of energy due to which we are able to see the objects which emits light for example objects like sun, lamp, candle emits light of their own and thus they are known as <i>luminous objects</i>.</li>
					<li>There are objects like table , chair etc. which are not luminous objects and still we are able to see them and this happens because they reflects lights which falls on them from a luminous object like sun, lamp etc. and when this reflected light reaches our eyes we are able to see such non luminous objects.</li>
					<li>Light rays basically consist of electromagnetic waves which do not require any material medium (like solid, liquid or gas) for their propagation.</li>
					<li>The wavelength of visible light waves is very small and is of the order of 4×10−7m to 8×10−7m .</li>
					<li>Speed of light waves depends on the medium through which they pass as speed of light in air is slightly less than the speed of light in vacuum 8×108m/s same way speed of light in water and glass is much less than that in air.</li>
					<li>When light falls on the surface of an object it can either be
						<ol>
							<li><i>Absorbed</i>:- If an object absorbs all the light falling on it , then it will appear perfectly black for example a blackboard</li>
							<li><i>Transmitted</i>: - An object is said to transmit light if it allows light to pass through itself and such objects are transparent.</li>
							<li><i>Reflected</i>:- If an object sends back light rays falling on its surface then it is said to have reflected the light</li>
