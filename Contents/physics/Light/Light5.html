				<ul>
					<li>In order to construct a ray diagram to find out the position, nature and size of image formed by convex mirror we should remember following path of rays of light.</li>
					<li>A ray of light parallel to the principle axis of a convex mirror appears to be coming from its focus after reflection from the mirror.</li>
					<li>A ray of light going towards the centre of curvature of convex mirror is reflected back along its own path.</li>
					<li>Convex mirrors have its focus and center of curvature behind it and no light can go behind the convex mirror and all the rays that we show behind the convex mirror are virtual and no ray actually passes through the focus and center of curvature of the convex mirror.</li>
					<li>Whatever be the position of object in front of convex mirror, the image formed by a convex mirror is always behind the mirror, virtual, erect and smaller than the object.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Convex mirrors are used as rear view mirrors in automobiles to see the traffic at back side as they give erect images and also highly diminished one giving the wide field view of traffic behind.</p>
