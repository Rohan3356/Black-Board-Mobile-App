					<li>The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or outwards.</li>
					<li>Spherical mirrors are of two types
						<ol>
							<li><b>Concave mirror: -</b> In a concave mirror reflection of light takes place at the concave surface or bent-in surface.</li>
							<li><b>Convex mirror:-</b> In a convex mirror reflection of light takes place at the convex surface or bent out surface </li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Commonly used terms about Spherical mirrors :
						<ol>
							<li><b>Centre of curvature:</b> The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere. This sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that the centre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting surface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it. However, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror as shown above in the figure 2.</li>
							<li><b>Radius of curvature:</b>The radius of the sphere of which the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius of curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R.</li>
							<li><b>Pole:</b>The center of a spherical mirror is called its pole and is represented by letter P as can be seen in figure 2.</li>
							<li><b>Principle axis:</b>Straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror is called principle axis of the mirror</li>
							<li><b>Aperture of the mirror:</b>Portion of the mirror from which reflection of light actually takes place is called the aperture of the mirror. Aperture of the mirror actually represents the size of the mirror</li>
