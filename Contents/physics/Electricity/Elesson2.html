					<li>Electric charge is a fundamental property like mass; length etc. associated with elementary particles for example electron, proton and many more.</li>
					<li>Electric charge is the property responsible for electric forces which acts between nucleus and electron to bind the atom together.</li>
					<li>Charges are of two kinds</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Negative charge</li>
						<li>Positive charge</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Electrons are negatively charged particles and protons, of which nucleus is made of, are positively charged particles. Actually nucleus is made of protons and neutrons but neutrons are uncharged particles.</li>
					<li>Electric force between two electrons is same as electric force between two protons kept at same distance apart i.e., both set repel each other but electric force between an electron and proton placed at same distance apart is not repulsive but attractive in nature</li>
					<li>All free charges are integral multiples of a unit of charge e, where e = -1.602 Ã— 10 -19 C i. e., charge on an electron or proton.</li>
					<li>Thus charge q on a body is always denoted by
						q = ne
						where n = any integer positive or negative
