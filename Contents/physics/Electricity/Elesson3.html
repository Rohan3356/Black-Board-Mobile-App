					<li>There is a category of materials in which electric charges can flow easily while in other materials charges cannot flow easily.</li>
					<li>Substances through which electric charges can flow easily are called conductors. All metals like copper, aluminum etc. are good conductors of electricity.</li>
					<li>Substances through which electric charges cannot flow are called insulators.</li>
					<li>Few examples of insulating materials are glass, rubber, mica, plastic, dry wood etc.</li>
					<li>Presence or absence of free electrons in a material makes it a conductor or insulator.</li>
					<li>Conductors have free electrons which are loosely held by nuclei of their atoms whereas insulators do not have free electrons as in insulators electrons are strongly held by nuclei of their atoms.</li>

				<h4 style="color: skyblue;">Question 1</h4>
				<p>Calculate the number of electrons constituting one Coulomb of charge? (Charge on 1 electron = 1.6 ×10-19C)</p>
				<h4 style="color: skyblue;">Solution</h4>
				<p>We know that n=qe<br>So, n=11.6×10−19=6.25×1018</p>

				<h4 style="color: skyblue;">Question 2</h4>
				<p>What is the difference between static and current electricity?<br><span style="color: skyblue; font-size: 20px;">Answer</span></p>

						<td>It is caused by the buildup of electrical charges on the surface of objects.</td>
						<td>It is generated by batteries and power plants</td>

					<tr>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>It is usually uncontrolled, and just happens occasionally or at irregular intervals.</td>
						<td>It is normally controlled, and it is the more used phenomenon of electricity, in countless applications.</td>
