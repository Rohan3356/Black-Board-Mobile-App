				<h4 style="color: deepskyblue;">Two Mark Questions</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Name the unit of (a) electrical resistance (b) resistivity</li>
					<li>Define One Ohm</li>
					<li>Define Resistivity</li>
					<li>Determine the direction of conventional current?</li>
					<li>What is electrical power? Write its unit.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4 style="color: deepskyblue;">Three Mark Questions</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>You take two resistors of resistance 2R and 3R and connect them in parallel in an electric circuit. Calculate the ratio of the electrical power consumed by 2R and 3R?</li>
					<li>A small bulb has a resistance of 2Î© when cold. It takes up a current of 0.4 A from a source of 4V and then starts glowing. Calculate (i) the resistance of the bulb when it is glowing and
						(ii) Elaborate on the reason for the difference in resistance?
					</li>
					<li>Define resistance and resistivity and also give the relation between them. Explain the dependence of resistance on temperature.</li>
					<li>A bulb is rated at 330V- 110W. What do you think is its resistance? Three such bulbs burn for 5hrs at a stretch. What is the energy consumed? Calculate the cost in rupees if the rate is 70 paisa per unit?</li>
					<li>Calculate the resistance of 2 km long copper wire of radius 2 mm. (Resistivity of copper = 1.72 x 1 0-8)</li>
					<li>What connection is used in domestic appliances and why?</li>
					<li>A 250 watt electric bulb is lighted for 5 hours daily and four 6 watt bulbs are lighted for 4.5 hours daily. Calculate the energy consumed (in kWh) in the month of February.</li>
