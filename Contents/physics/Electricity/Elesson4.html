				<ul>
					<li>Rate of doing work or the rate of consumption of energy is known as <b>POWER</b><br>Mathematically,<br><i>power=Work done/time taken</i></li>
					<li>SI unit of power is Watt which is denoted by letter W. The power of 1 Watt is a rate of working of 1 Joule per second. Actually Watt is a small unit; therefore, a bigger unit of electric power called Kilowatt is used for commercial purposes. Also ,
						1 kilowatt = 1000 Watts
						So,<br>
						<b>The rate at which electric work is done or the rate at which electric energy is consumed is called electric power</b>

					</li>
					<li>We will now derive formula for the calculation of electric power.
						From equation 14 we know that<br><i>power=Work done/time taken</i><br>Now we know that work done W by current I when it flows for time t under a potential difference V is given by<br><i>W=P*I*t joule</i>
					</li>

				<p>This additional information is related to particular chapter. Please have a look at them for your best outcomes.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We have three formulas for calculating electric power. These are </li>
					<ol>
						<li>P=V×I </li>
						<li>P=I2×R </li>
						<li>P=V2R <br>You must memorize these formulas as they would be used to solve numerical problems.</li>
					</ol>
					<li>When electrical appliance consumes electrical energy at the rate of 1 Joule per second, its power is said to be 1 Watt.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Rate at which electric work is done or the rate, at which electric energy is consumed, is called electrical power.</p>
