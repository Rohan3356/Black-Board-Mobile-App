					Physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge is known as electricity. Electricity and electrical phenomenon have a lot of applications in our day to day life and they also gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction and the flow of electrical current.
				</p>
				<h3 style="color: skyblue;">Electricity occurs due to several types :</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Electric charge:</b> A property of some subatomic particles, which determines their electromagnetic interactions.</li>
					<li><b>Electric current: </b>A movement or flow of electrically charged particles, typically measured in amperes.</li>
					<li><b>Electric field: </b>An especially simple type of electromagnetic field produced by an electric charge even when it is not moving (i.e., there is no electric current). The electric field produces a force on other charges in its vicinity. Moving charges additionally produce a magnetic field.</li>
					<li><b>Electric potential: </b>The capacity of an electric field to do work on an electric charge, typically measured in volts.</li>
